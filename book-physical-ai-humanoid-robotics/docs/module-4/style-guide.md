# VLA Module Style Guide

This style guide provides specific guidance for creating content in the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module.

## Writing Style

### Tone and Voice
- Use an educational, informative tone appropriate for AI + Robotics learners
- Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- Avoid overly casual language while remaining approachable
- Use active voice wherever possible

### Terminology
- Use "VLA systems" to refer to Vision-Language-Action systems
- Use "Large Language Models" or "LLMs" (acronym defined on first use)
- Use "robot action" or "robot behavior" rather than "robot task" when referring to specific movements
- Use "natural language command" rather than "voice command" when referring to text-based input

### Technical Concepts
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Use consistent naming for system components (Vision, Language, Action)
- When referencing specific technologies, use full names on first mention followed by common abbreviations (e.g., "OpenAI Whisper (Whisper)" or "Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)")

## Content Structure

### Chapter Organization
- Begin each chapter with clear learning objectives
- Include an overview section introducing the main concepts
- Break content into digestible sections with descriptive headings
- End each chapter with a summary and key takeaways

### Diagrams and Visuals
- Include conceptual diagrams to illustrate system architecture
- Use consistent visual elements and color schemes
- Provide clear captions explaining what each diagram represents
- Ensure diagrams support the text rather than replacing it

## Examples and Scenarios

### Example Selection
- Use practical, real-world scenarios that illustrate key concepts
- Include step-by-step breakdowns for complex processes
- Focus on simulation-based examples that learners can conceptualize
- Provide both successful and challenging scenarios to illustrate system limitations

### Code Examples
- When including code snippets, provide context for what the code accomplishes
- Use comments to explain key parts of the code
- Focus on pseudocode or conceptual examples rather than specific implementations
- Explain how the code relates to the broader system architecture

## Cross-References

### Internal Links
- Link to related concepts within the VLA module when relevant
- Reference concepts from previous modules when building on prior knowledge
- Use descriptive link text that indicates what the user will learn by following the link

### External References
- Cite authoritative sources for technical information
- Include links to official documentation for technologies mentioned
- Reference academic papers or research when appropriate for deeper understanding
